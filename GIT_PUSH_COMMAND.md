## Latest Changes - Version History Tracking Fix (With Access Token)
```bash
cd /home/runner/workspace && rm -f .git/index.lock && git remote set-url origin https://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@github.com/tsiemasilo/CVDatabase.git && git add . && git commit -m "Fix: Resolve version history tracking issue

✅ Fixed critical bug where version history wasn't being recorded for UI changes
✅ Added anonymous fallback tracking for when session authentication fails  
✅ Enhanced debugging logs to identify session authentication problems
✅ Version history now captures all CV record changes with proper field-level tracking

Technical Details:
- Diagnosed session authentication problem: sessions existed but lacked user context
- Implemented anonymous fallback version history tracking for reliability
- System now tracks what changed, when, and by whom (or 'system' for anonymous changes)
- Verified version history records are being created and stored properly
- UI now displays changes immediately after they're made

Issue Resolution: Changes made through UI weren't being recorded due to session authentication failures. Now all changes are tracked regardless of session state." && git push -u origin main
```
