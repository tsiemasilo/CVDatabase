# Database Synchronization Status

## Current Configuration ✅ ACTIVE

Both Replit development and production (Netlify) environments are configured to use the **same Neon PostgreSQL database**:

### Database Details
- **Provider**: Neon PostgreSQL (Serverless)
- **Connection**: `ep-lucky-recipe-aes0pb5o-pooler.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`
- **Database**: `neondb`
- **SSL Mode**: Required with channel binding

### Environment Configuration
- **Development (Replit)**: Uses `DATABASE_URL` 
- **Production (Netlify)**: Uses `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL`
- **Both URLs point to the same database instance**

### Synchronization Features
1. **Real-time Data Sync**: Changes made in either environment appear immediately in both
2. **Shared Tables**: All tables (cv_records, version_history, user_profiles, etc.) are shared
3. **Cache Invalidation**: Enhanced to refetch data when users switch between environments
4. **Version History Tracking**: All changes are tracked regardless of which environment makes them

### How It Works
- **Single Source of Truth**: One database serves both environments
- **Automatic Sync**: No manual synchronization needed
- **Cross-Environment Updates**: Changes in Replit development instantly appear on production
- **Bidirectional**: Changes on production website instantly appear in Replit

### Verification
To verify synchronization is working:
1. Make a change in Replit development environment
2. Check production website - change should appear immediately
3. Make a change on production website
4. Check Replit development - change should appear immediately

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Driver**: @neondatabase/serverless with connection pooling
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with real-time queries
- **Cache Strategy**: 30-second stale time with window focus refresh
- **Authentication**: Shared across environments with proper session handling

## Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
Last Verified: August 21, 2025
Both environments successfully sharing the same database with real-time synchronization.
