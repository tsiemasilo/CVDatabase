# Netlify Debug Information

## Current Status
- Netlify function has all 30 API routes including version history
- Version history routes are correctly defined in netlify/functions/api.js
- Production database has version_history table with proper structure
- Routes work perfectly in development environment

## Debugging Added
Added console.log statements to version history routes to track:
1. Route execution
2. Storage object creation
3. Method calls
4. Results returned

## Next Steps for User
1. Deploy this debug version
2. Try accessing version history on production
3. Check Netlify function logs in dashboard:
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com
   - Select your site
   - Go to Functions tab
   - Click on "api" function
   - View the logs to see if routes are being called

## Expected Debug Output
If working correctly, logs should show:
```
Version history route hit: { tableName: 'cv_records', recordId: '37' }
Storage obtained: object
Calling getRecordVersionHistory: cv_records 37
Version history result: X records
```

If failing, logs will show the exact error preventing the routes from working.

## Production Issue Investigation
The routes exist but something is preventing them from being accessible. Possible causes:
1. Import/module resolution issues in Netlify environment  
2. Database connection problems in serverless context
3. Route registration not happening due to async initialization issues
4. Netlify function timeout or cold start problems

Debug logs will reveal the exact issue.
